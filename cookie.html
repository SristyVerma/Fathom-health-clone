                    <strong>What are cookies?<br>‍</strong>
                    Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.&nbsp; 
                    Cookies serve different purposes, like helping us understand how a site is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, 
                    remembering your preferences and generally improving your browsing experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Our Sites may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them).&nbsp;
                    We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites;
                    and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers or business partners on our Sites, and can be used by these parties to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.
                    Third party cookies can be used for a variety of purposes, including site analytics, advertising and social media features.<br><br>
                    <strong>What types of cookies and similar tracking technologies does Fathom use on the Sites?<br>‍</strong>

    <strong>Other technologies<br></strong>
    In addition to cookies, our Sites and emails may use other technologies to collect information.&nbsp;
    For example, we may use web beacons (which are also known as pixel tags and clear GIFs) on our Sites and in our HTML formatted emails to track the actions of users on our Sites and interactions with our emails.
    Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages or within HTML formatted emails. Pixel tags are used to demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that certain content was viewed, typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our emails (e.g., they may tell us whether you have opened an email, and/or forwarded it on to someone else) and to compile statistics about usage of the Sites, so that we can manage our content more effectively.<br>‍<br>
    <strong>Your choices</strong><br>Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies.&nbsp; To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings.&nbsp; Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings.&nbsp; 
    Please note that if you set your browser to disable cookies, the Sites may not work properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>‍<br>For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.&nbsp; If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Sites. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you visit our Sites.<br>‍<br>

            <p>
              There have been public calls for more pricing transparency in
              healthcare for decades, but limited public interest in an issue
              that few felt (or could even attribute) acutely.

              explicitly aiming to force providers and plans to operate with
              greater transparency, many RCM operations will scramble to set up
              the infrastructure necessary to support transparency. Given that
              few have the technology, operations, or infrastructure in place to
              offer transparency, it will take time, but there is finally
              momentum.

            <p><strong>2. Widespread automation ü§ñ</strong></p>
            <p>
              If there was a healthcare executive at the JP Morgan conference
              who didn‚Äôt speak about automation, I must have missed it. 2019 saw
              automation technologies prove themselves across a number of
              functions, particularly on the administrative side, providing
              organizations with the case studies and evidence needed to push
              through new initiatives.

              and security of their personal data. This increased awareness is
              coming amidst a broad movement of data towards the cloud and many,
              if not all, revenue cycle functions to outside service providers.
              Providers will mitigate risk by demanding higher standards of
              security and compliance from all their vendors. Good news for
              audit and certification firms.

              hoping to take the technology that had made Alexa and Siri
              household names and use it to finally free physicians from
              documentation--an AI scribe that would passive listen to an
              encounter and create notes. Unfortunately, the bar for accuracy
              combined with the technical challenge of distilling a conversation
              (rather than direct dictation) to accurate and concise clinical
              notes is far beyond current technology. Expect to see these

            <p><strong>6. Clean, well-structured data üß±</strong></p>
            <p>
              As both vendors and providers continue to see their efforts to
              adopt new technologies get blocked or hamstrung by issues of data
              access, format, and fragmentation, look for large investments in
              data unification efforts that will allow organizations to more
              easily adopt or build in-house solutions.
            </p>
            <p><strong>7. Growth in outpatient CDI üìÅ</strong></p>
            <p>
              The AHA has reported that outpatient revenue is now roughly
              equivalent (95%) to inpatient revenue for American hospitals<a

                target="_blank"
                >[1]</a
              >. Naturally, with the increased revenue comes increased revenue
              risk. Thorough and accurate documentation in the outpatient
              setting will play a more meaningful role in revenue integrity than
              ever. As coding automation rates increase due to technologies like
              ours, look for RCM operations to increasingly deploy their coders
              to outpatient CDI efforts alongside the adoption of tools like

              One of the PE community‚Äôs favorite hunting grounds is about to be
              overrun by Stanford grads in Patagonia vests. Over the last couple
              of years, we have seen a remarkable number of companies coming
              through YCombinator or being funded by tier-one venture funds that
              are focused on addressing various pieces of the revenue cycle.
              While not all of these firms have found strong product-market fit,
              they have educated the venture capital community on both the scale
              of the revenue cycle industry and the opportunities for technology
              to transform it.
